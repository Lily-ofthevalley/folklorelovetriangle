<h2>The Story</h2>
<pre>

    The story in Taylor Swifts album folklore between the songs August, Cardigan and Betty is about three people.
    Their names are Betty, James and Augusta their story is called a love triangle by most people even tho it isnt.
    Their story is about James who over the summer break cheated on Betty with Augusta and how it effected the three
    of them and what they think about it. The songs never quiet finish the story but Taylor confirmed that Betty And
    James got back together but after sometime Betty broke up with James cause she couldn't get herself to forgive him.
