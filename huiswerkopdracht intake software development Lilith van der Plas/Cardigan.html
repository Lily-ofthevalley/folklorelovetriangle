<h2>The story behind Cardigan</h2>
<pre>
                The song Cardigan is from the perspective of Betty. She sings about how she already knew that James
                was cheating on her even tho he thought shse didnt know. She then goes on to sing about how she felt
                like a used cardigan impling how she felt throw aside for something new. She then continues to sing about
                how James spent the weekends with her but secretly spent all his other time with Augusta. After that she
                sings about how badly James hurt her and how he kept making it worse without him knowing it. At the end of
                the song she sings about how she knew that James would come back to her after all he had done. And at the
                end she talks about how it made her feel just like how she felt when she first found out and how James acted
                as if everything was fine.

<h3>Lyrics</h3>
<pre style="text-align: center;">
                Vintage tee, brand new phone
                High heels on cobblestones
                When you are young, they assume you know nothing
                Sequin smile, black lipstick
                Sensual politics
                When you are young, they assume you know nothing
                But I knew you
                Dancin' in your Levi's
                Drunk under a streetlight, I
                I knew you
                Hand under my sweatshirt
                Baby, kiss it better, I
                And when I felt like I was an old cardigan
                Under someone's bed
                you put me on and said I was your favorite
                A friend to all is a friend to none
                Chase two girls, lose the one
                When you are young, they assume you know nothin'
                But I knew you
                Playing hide-and-seek and
                Giving me your weekends, I
                I knew you
                Your heartbeat on the High Line
                Once in 20 lifetimes, I
                And when I felt like I was an old cardigan
                Under someone's bed
                You put me on and said I was your favorite
                To kiss in cars and downtown bars
                Was all we needed
                You drew stars around my scars
                But now I'm bleedin'
                'Cause I knew you
                Steppin' on the last train
                Marked me like a bloodstain, I
                I knew you
                Tried to change the ending
                Peter losing Wendy, I
                I knew you
                Leavin' like a father
                Running like water, I
                And when you are young, they assume you know nothing
                But I knew you'd linger like a tattoo kiss
                I knew you'd haunt all of my what-ifs
                The smell of smoke would hang around this long
                'Cause I knew everything when I was young
                I knew I'd curse you for the longest time
                Chasin' shadows in the grocery line
                I knew you'd miss me once the thrill expired
                And you'd be standin' in my front porch light
                And I knew you'd come back to me
                You'd come back to me
                And you'd come back to me
                And you'd come back
                And when I felt like I was an old cardigan
                Under someone's bed
                You put me on and said I was your favorite
