<h2>The story behind Betty</h2>
<pre>
               The song Betty from the perspective of James who thinks about what he did to Betty And
               how he regrets what he did. He thinks about all the regrets he had about what he did with
               Augusta. He then goes on to thinks about how he thinks cheating on her was the worst thing 
               he ever did and how he hopes Betty will take him back en tho she had to find about via rumars
               that he cheated on her. Later in the song he fantasizes about getting back with Betty and how 
               he planned on going to her party and hoping that she would take him back. In the end of the song
               he goes to party and and thinks about getting things back to normal.

<h3>Lyrics</h3>
<pre style="text-align: center;">
                Betty, I won't make assumptions
                About why you switched your homeroom but
                I think it's 'cause of me
                Betty, one time I was riding on my skateboard
                When I passed your house
                It's like I couldn't breathe
                You heard the rumors from Inez
                You can't believe a word she says
                Most times, but this time it was true
                The worst thing that I ever did
                Was what I did to you
                But if I just showed up at your party
                Would you have me?
                Would you want me?
                Would you tell me to go fuck myself?
                Or lead me to the garden?
                In the garden would you trust me
                If I told you it was just a summer thing?
                I'm only 17, I don't know anything
                But I know I miss you
                Betty, I know where it all went wrong
                Your favorite song was playing
                From the far side of the gym
                I was nowhere to be found
                I hate the crowds, you know that
                Plus, I saw you dance with him
                You heard the rumors from Inez
                You can't believe a word she says
                Most times, but this time it was true
                The worst thing that I ever did
                Was what I did to you
                But if I just showed up at your party
                Would you have me?
                Would you want me?
                Would you tell me to go fuck myself?
                Or lead me to the garden?
                In the garden would you trust me
                If I told you it was just a summer thing?
                I'm only seventeen, I don't know anything
                But I know I miss you
                I was walking home on broken cobblestones
                Just thinking of you when she pulled up like
                A figment of my worst intentions
                She said "James, get in, let's drive"
                Those days turned into nights
                Slept next to her, but
                I dreamt of you all summer long
                Betty, I'm here on your doorstep
                And I planned it out for weeks now
                But it's finally sinkin' in
                Betty, right now is the last time
                I can dream about what happens when
                You see my face again
                The only thing I wanna do
                Is make it up to you
                So I showed up at your party
                Yeah, I showed up at your party
                Yeah, I showed up at your party
                Will you have me?
                Will you love me?
                Will you kiss me on the porch
                In front of all your stupid friends?
                If you kiss me, will it be just like I dreamed it?
                Will it patch your broken wings?
                I'm only 17, I don't know anything
                But I know I miss you
                Standing in your cardigan
                Kissin' in my car again
                Stopped at a streetlight
                You know I miss you
