<h2>The story behind August</h2>
<pre> 
                The song August is about a girl people call Augusta and the relationship she had with james that didnt work out.
                She sings about how she hoped that her relationship with james would workout and how it didn't.
                She also sings about all the fun times they had in the summer break and how she hopes he remembers them.
                During the song she comes to realize that James was never hers to love and that
                he never loved her the same way she loved him. Yet she still hopes he'll come back to her
                and lover her just like she keeps wishing he would.

<h3>Lyrics</h3>
<pre style="text-align: center;">
                Salt air, and the rust on your door
                I never needed anything more
                Whispers of "Are you sure?"
                "Never have I ever before"
                But I can see us lost in the memory
                August slipped away into a moment in time
                'Cause it was never mine
                And I can see us twisted in bedsheets
                August sipped away like a bottle of wine
                'Cause you were never mine
                Your back beneath the sun
                Wishin' I could write my name on it
                Will you call when you're back at school?
                I remember thinkin' I had you
                But I can see us lost in the memory
                August slipped away into a moment in time
                'Cause it was never mine
                And I can see us twisted in bedsheets
                August sipped away like a bottle of wine
                'Cause you were never mine
                Back when we were still changin' for the better
                Wanting was enough
                For me, it was enough
                To live for the hope of it all
                Cancel plans just in case you'd call
                And say, "Meet me behind the mall"
                So much for summer love and saying "us"
                'Cause you weren't mine to lose
                You weren't mine to lose, no
                But I can see us lost in the memory
                August slipped away into a moment in time
                'Cause it was never mine
                And I can see us twisted in bedsheets
                August sipped away like a bottle of wine
                'Cause you were never mine
                'Cause you were never mine, never mine
                But do you remember?
                Remember when I pulled up and said, "Get in the car"
                And then canceled my plans just in case you'd call?
                Back when I was livin' for the hope of it all, for the hope of it all
                "Meet me behind the mall"
                Remember when I pulled up and said, "Get in the car"
                And then canceled my plans just in case you'd call?
                Back when I was livin' for the hope of it all (for the hope of it all)
                For the hope of it all
                For the hope of it all
                (For the hope of it all)
                (For the hope of it all)
